# Student Program Graph Web Application

## Project Overview
This web application allows users to view a graphical representation of students' distribution across different academic programs. It retrieves student data from an SQL Server database and uses **Chart.js** to generate a dynamic pie chart displaying the number of students per program. The application is built with **ASP.NET Core MVC** and connects to a **SQL Server** database to manage student information.

## Features
- **Graphical View**: Users can see a pie chart that displays the number of students in different academic programs (Computer Science, Information Technology, and Software Engineering).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Data Integration**: The student data is dynamically fetched from a SQL Server database using an ASP.NET Core backend.
- **Chart.js**: The project uses Chart.js to create interactive pie charts based on the student data.
